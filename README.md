Hello everyone, I have ported RDE peds over to FiveM. In this mod, I do NOT include the peds from RDE themselves to respect the rights of Dilapidated and the rest of the RDE team. I have made it VERY easy to port the peds over. Heres how to do it.

Step 1: Have RDE download
Step 2: Open the RDE downloaded file
Step 3: When you do that, you should see "Optional Addons", "Uninstaller.OIV", "Readme.txt", and "RDE4.0.3.OIV"
KEEP IN MIND, YOU DO NEED 4.0 OR OLDER FOR THIS PORT TO WORK
Step 4: Open "RDE4.0.3.OIV"
Step 5: You should see "content", "icon.png", and "assembly.xml"
Step 6: Click on "content"
Step 7: Once your there you should see a ton of stuff, click on the FOLDER that says "rde" on it
Step 8: Once your there, you should see a dlc.rpf file, next step is important
Step 9: Open up OPENIV, and create a folder named "test" in the game directory, preferably in the game base folder where GTAV.exe is located
Step 10: Drag the dlc.rpf file that is found in the RDE files and drag it into the test folder you created
Step 11: Open the dlc.rpf and go to componentpeds and take all of the files in componentpeds and drag them into the "stream" folder on my mod
Step 12: Go to componentpeds_p and drag all of that into the pedprops folder inside the "stream" folder on my mod

There you go, if you did everything correctly everything should be working fine. Thank you to the RDE Team for making the base of this mod. I aprreciate everything you guys do. Thank you!!!
